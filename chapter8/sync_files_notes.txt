mantra_common_1 (newer one being in test1) see to it that file has some thing in
it to say test2

mantra_common_2 (newer one being in test2) see to it that file has some thing in

09:33 finshed setting up test harnesses. 
----------------------------

Made a backup of the files. 
cp -rf test2 test2-backup
cp -rf test1 test1-backup

Starting code. 
Test harnesses 
/sync_files.sh dir1 dir2 dir3
Usage: ./sync_files.sh [dir1] [dir2]

./sync_files.sh dir1 
Usage: ./sync_files.sh [dir1] [dir2]

Testing if  directories exist and are writable. 
./sync_files.sh  /home/arvind/test2 /home/arvind/test1

./sync_files.sh  /home/arvind/test2 /home/arvind/dir1
Both /home/arvind/test2 and /home/arvind/dir1 should exist and be writable 
                                
./sync_files.sh  /home/arvind/dir1 /home/arvind/test2 
Both /home/arvind/dir1 and /home/arvind/test2 should exist and be writable

Two non existent directories. 
./sync_files.sh  /home/arvind/dir1 /home/arvind/dir2
Both /home/arvind/dir1 and /home/arvind/dir2 should exist and be writable
